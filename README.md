# FileOrganizer

Hey dear user. This is a simple project I did to train my programming skills.
The goal of this project was to create a simple file organizer that would store your files in different folders according to their extensions.

Things you should know before running this app:

-It is required of you to manually input the folder you wish to organize. For example if it is a folder in your desktop you must add you folder path to the folder variable on the main function, something like this:"C://desktop/myFolder";

-This app has the option of simulating the organizer without you actually moving any files. For this to work you must put the variable dry_run as True on the main function. It is true by default. If you put False it will actually move your files.

-If you have any extension that you want organize that is not on the app right now, just do the following: on the CATEGORIES list on top add your folder name and add the extensions like .fbx or .mcee or whatever you want to add. Just make sure you follow the scheme of the others if you are not sure on how to do it. 

-Last but not least, please send me any feedback on what could be improved and tips if you have for me. I am still young and learning this world of technology. Any feedback is appreciated!
